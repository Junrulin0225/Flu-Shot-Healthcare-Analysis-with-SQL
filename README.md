4 files (conditions, encounters, immunizations, and patients) were used to observe some insights with SQL.

#### Insights
##### Data Analysis with SQL
- The city of Worcester has the most patients.
- By joining 2 files (immunization & patients), I can see all the patients who got their flu shots.
- I can see the total percentage of patients getting flu shots according to age, race, and county.

##### Data Visualization with Tableau
- 4023 flu shots were given to patients in 2022.
- Patients between 50 to 64 years old had the highest flu shot rate in 2022.
- In 2022, Native Americans had the highest flu shot rate compared to other races.
